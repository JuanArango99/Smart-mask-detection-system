A good way take care of ourselves from COVID-19 is the following of the biosafety protocols, and a smart system that
detects the well use of mask would be a good idea to automatize the entry of people to certain places.

This system recognizes the mask usage using Arduino, Python, Object Detection and Deep Learning.

This project designs a prototipe that allows the entry to a room by detecting the correct usage of mask with Deep Learning techniques and Object 
Detection using Python 3.7 and OpenCV. Depending on the model response, it communicates with Arduino UNO through serial port. Finally, Arduino is responsible for opening 
the gates, turning LEDs on/off, and text display on a LCD 16x2.
